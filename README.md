<p>
In this example we have our user Ken creating a ticket and reporting their issue.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Ticket Assignment</h2>

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60251858-1be7-4aa0-9a16-fc3369dc8e6b) -->

<p>
In this example we have our support agent John to login and work on this ticket.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Communication</h2>

<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd548f3f-498f-409c-8631-eaec21407630) -->

<p>
In this example we can have our agent John see this Ticket and update its priority, and have the Sev-A emergency ticket reassigned to a System Administrator. We can also make sure he leaves a proper message in place with any additional information.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Working The Ticket</h2>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab6c997b-f363-4e2d-9432-5683df20bdc9" height="80%" width="80%" />
<!-- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab6c997b-f363-4e2d-9432-5683df20bdc9) -->

<p>
In this example we can have our agent Jenny work on the issue to completion and communicate back with the previous agent John, also switching the status of the issure from open to resolved.
</p>
<br />

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>
On our previous support agent John's side he can see that the System Administrator agent Jenny left him a message and that ticket is now closed. With that this demonstrates a very simple scenario of a user creating a ticket, how the ticket gets assigned, and communication between agents.
